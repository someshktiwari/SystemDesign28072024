GUI - Mac and Windows
Features - buttons and checkboxes

We will design both features(products) first
1. Buttons
2. Checkboxes

We will design interfaces for both and created classes for windows and mac

Now we will create Abstract Factory(GUI factory) -

GUI factory produces -
1. Buttons using createButton method
2. Checkboxes using createCheckbox method

Both Windows and Mac Classes will use GUIFactory interface

Both WindowsFactory and MacFactory are Concrete Factories where GUIFactory is Abstract Factory that provides blueprint.

Application(Client Code) - Users don't care what factory method they use since they work through abstract interfaces
